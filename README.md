This project is divided into two parts. First the model making, which is stored as Customer_Behavior python file. second part of the project is deployment using flask app which stored into Deployment_12_03_24.

The main objective of this project is to make prediciton wheather the E commerce customer generate the revenue or not. The prediction is carried out with four different classification models, from which Random forest perform the best.In additon to this, dataset was highly imbalanced , so to overcome this problem, i have used SMOT method which addresses the class imbalance problem into dataset.

Further for deployment , I have used Flask app, which a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python.
